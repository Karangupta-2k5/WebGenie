**WebGenie** is an AI-powered full-stack SaaS application that enables users to generate complete, responsive websites using natural language prompts. Instead of manually writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, users simply describe the type of website they want (e.g., “Create a modern digital agency portfolio”), and WebGenie instantly generates structured frontend code.

The platform is built using the **PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)** and integrates advanced AI models via OpenRouter for intelligent code generation. It includes a live preview engine that renders generated websites in a secure iframe, allowing users to edit elements such as text, colors, spacing, and layout in real time.

WebGenie operates on a **credit-based monetization system**, where users receive free credits upon registration and can purchase additional credits via Stripe integration. Each generation or revision consumes credits, making the platform scalable and business-ready.

Key features include:
AI-powered text-to-website generation
Live responsive preview (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop simulation)
Element-level editing panel
Version history and rollback system
Credit-based economy with Stripe payments
Public community hub for sharing projects

The system is deployed using modern cloud infrastructure and follows secure production practices, including environment-based configuration, database ORM (Prisma), and HTTPS-enabled hosting.
WebGenie aims to democratize web development by reducing the technical barrier to website creation while maintaining flexibility, scalability, and real-world SaaS architecture.
